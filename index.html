<hr/>
<p> Tampines ActiveSG Gym, formerly known as Tampines ClubFITT Gym, is a public gym operated by Sport Singapore. <br/>
<br/>
Tampines Sport Centre, formerly known as Tampines Sport and Recreation Centre, is located just across the Tampines regional centre, and boasts one of the biggest ActiveSG gyms. Its location allows it to appeal to both the residents and tertiary students within the estate, and also the working adults from the regional centre. <br/>
<br/>
This centre is also one of the only gyms that provides a Ladies Hour for strictly the ladies only. This is very beneficial for the ladies that are shy to gym in front of the guys, as well as those that would like to use the weights as well as machines that the guys always hog. <br/>
<br/>
Tampines has undergone significant upgrades for its swimming complex, and continues to provide value for money recreational activities for its community. Looking ahead, its current positioning will favour it to tap into the emerging trend of lifestyle services <br/>
